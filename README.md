# Soap-php
SOAP (abbreviation for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.


## How does it work ?

For Example we have two host or server

Server 1 : this server is a get Requests
you must upload ```server.php``` and ```wsdl.wsdl``` to this server

Server 2 : this server is a Client and get Response
in this server you must upload ```client.php```

### For Run

Run client.php and then get response from <b>Server 1</b> in Server 1 check requests and return response 

in client.php print \"How Are you ?\"

Print the text above The review has been completed successfully 

### Note : Edit ```Client.php``` , ```wsdl.wsdl``` find <b>example.com</b> and set your URL site
